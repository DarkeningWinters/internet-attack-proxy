# Internet Attack Proxy

IAP is a debugging proxy for generic internet protocols,
many applications of various sizes and purposes are
vulnerable to attacks involving the re-use and forgery
of packets. Prior to IAP the ability to do so was limited
to those who made the tools for it or used outdated ones
such as Winsock Packet Editor. IAP is suited for penetration
testers who need to capture/resend packets through established connections.
